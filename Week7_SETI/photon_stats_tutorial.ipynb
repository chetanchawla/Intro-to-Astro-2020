Furthermore, these images are taken in multiple filters to add the dimension of color, helping to further distinguish between individual stars. Despite all this, as we look towards the center of the cluster in this image, it can be hard to see where the smaller stars end and begin. How do we know when we're actually seeing a star (or any manner of astronomical object) and when we're actually seeing noise?"

Three of these sources are due to our setup: thermal noise and readout noise from the electronics, and background noise from the atmosphere, light pollution, interstellar dust, zodiacal light and background stars and galaxies. Today we're going to focus specifically on the fourth type of noise, noise that comes from the star (or planet or galaxy) itself.\n",

We know how many photons arrived between 0 and 1 second, between 1 and 2 seconds and so on. From these counts we calculate an imperfect measure of the average number of photons that arrive per second, within the limits of 5 seconds, because that is all we measured. To make further [inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference) about the photon flux of our system we need to model the probability distribution of our photons.
