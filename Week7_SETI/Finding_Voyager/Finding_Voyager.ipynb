    "The second package we'll need to download is called `turboSETI` and is the official BL narrowband signal search pipeline. To break that down, turboSETI looks for very narrow frequency bands (~a few Hz) that contain anomalously high powers throughout an observation. It is even capable of following these signals if they drift off of their original frequency due to relative accelerations between the receiver on Earth and the transmitter out in space (very likely, as radial accelerations are *everywhere* in the universe). Finding these narrow signals would be exciting, because there's no astrophysical phenomenon that we know of that can get to bandwidths smaller than ~kHz (and those are radio masers, which are a very interesting topic in their own right). Not only that, but these very narrow signals are how we communicate to each other via GPS, cell signals, etc. on Earth! \n",

To do this, we'll follow the same steps as we did for `blimpy`.\n",

Now type `git clone https://github.com/Sofysicist/turbo_seti.git` (again, you can copy-paste the address from here, or the GitHub page using the `Code` button).

When we perform the search for hits with the `turbo.FindDoppler` function, we will have to specify the minimum signal-to-noise ratio and the maximum drift rate that we'd like in our search. For a more in-depth analysis of these parameters, check out the Finding_ETI notebook. Briefly: because Voyager is not fixed on the surface of Earth, it has a relative motion with respect to the telescope, which causes its apparent frequency to drift. The `max_drift` parameter specifies the maximum drift rate for the search with a unit of Hz/sec. `snr` sets the signal-to-noise ratio threshold for a spike to be considered a hit and added to the output table. The values that have been chosen below are tuned to make the rest of the notebook run smoothly (because in the case of Voyager, we actually know what we're looking for!) but feel free to play with them if you're curious.\n",
