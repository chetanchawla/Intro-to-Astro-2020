This week we will discuss our online profiles as Astronomers.
While twitter and facebook offer access to large numbers of peopele, having a personal website allows you to create something that is truly your own without the baggage of other online platforms. No one has to see ads, or be distracted by a comment or gif (unless you want that!). They can see your CV and know right away where your interest lie and how to contact you. By having your own website you can promote your own work, or perhaps your collaborators. As you build your online profile, someone can hopefully Google your name and you can be the first hit. 

Having a website will help you to find your place in Astronomy, as you add new content and establish your goals. But even with a website, occasionally we need to be reminded that we all belong here. One of the common feelings that students, researchers and even professors all share is we feel we are out place, we are not smart enough, we don't fit in, or we ended up in the place we are because of some sort of mistake or mixup.  Our paper reading topic today will be on stereo type threat (and imposter syndrome), and hopefully by acknowledging that this is a common malady in academia, we can move past these feelings into a more confident position.
