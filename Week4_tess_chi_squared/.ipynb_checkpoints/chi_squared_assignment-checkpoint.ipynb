    "- the data was \"drawn\" from a Gaussian distribution\n",
    "- each measurement was independent\n",

    "In general, each of these assumptions can eventually be violated, e.g. each measurement could have a different measurement uncertainty, the data may not actually follow a Gaussian distribution (think photon counting), and data points may have some covariance (not independent measurements). For now we'll hold on to these assumptions to keep things simple, but it's always a good idea to be cognizant of the validity of the assumptions that go into your analysis.\n",
