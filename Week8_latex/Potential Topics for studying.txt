- Look up the most popular and most cited papers. You can skip the crazy maths
- Focus more on what has been done already, What is the state of research and make a thing as to what can you do in this field
- Read papers to get an idea on the field
- Lookup one paper from each field- Glimpse through the paper and see if there is something that particularly interests me
