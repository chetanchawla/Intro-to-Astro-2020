This week we reach the halfway point of the Intro2Astro Series.  If you have made this far, then I hope you will stick with us the rest of the way. So far we have been exploring the latest and greatest data sources including TESS, Gaia and the Exoplanet Archive. Today we are going to do a deep dive into the the world of precise radial velocities, a world that has been at the center of my research career since the first night that I spent at the telescope in summer of 2004. So this is a topic very near to my heart. Measuring masses of exoplanets with precise radial velocities was the first method that resulted in measuring masses of planets around sun-like stars. That discovery took place in 1995, and only last year resulted in the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Physics. Back then, the Python language was yet to be invented, and "pip install Radvel" might as well have been science fiction.  But that was the past, and today we are bringing you cutting edge radial velocity analysis tools from the largest optical telescopes in the world. We have new statistical tools as well. We will see how we combine these measurements and the new tools to measure exoplanet masses with more precision than ever. These analyses result in finding and studying the most Earth-like planets ever detected outside the solar system and will help to determine the habitability of planets around stars beyond the Solar System.
