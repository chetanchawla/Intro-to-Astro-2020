# Confirmed is the term used when the mass is measured. We also use the term ‘verified’ for the instance when a planet is no longer a candidate, but we do not measure the mass. 
confirmed and verified have equal stature, but different meaning. 

# With Kepler we are sensitive to small planets and large planets, so when we find more small ones, that represents a real difference in nature in how many small planets form (lots!) and how many large planets form (fewer!) 

Q. Also would the habitable zone be constantly changing in a binary star system? 
A. Hmmm, that’s a good question. The habitable zone is mostly defined by the flux that is at a certain point, and whether the planet can sustain liquid water

A2. Around any one component of the binary, the HZ would be changing, but if a planet goes around both stars in a binary, a circumbinary planet, then the HZ is constant
