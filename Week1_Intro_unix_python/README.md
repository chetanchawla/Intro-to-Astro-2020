## Assignment of students to mentors
* On the google doc, check your name to mark your attendnce. Mentors will be assigned in Week 6 for review of your new websites and CVs and in week 9 for final projects. Until then please attend a mentor's office hour to chat with a mentor.

## Assignments for Week 1

### If you have not already:
 * Be sure to obtain all of the appropriate accounts listed on Timeline page. Update "Attendance" Google Doc.
 * Ensure that you have a working version of Python installed on your computer.
   * [This link](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#python) has a section for downloading the anaconda version of Python for Mac, Linux or Windows
 * Finish writing your goals for this program if you did not finish during the session.

### Assignment 1) Complete the Data Carpentry workshop on the Unix command shell
The Unix shell is the basis for scientific computing. By mastering shell commands you will save 
yourself hours of time in the future. What seems like a small investment will pay dividends again and again.

Right now, follow this link to the setup page. You will need to do this on your own, either with the class or offline
[Link to setup](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html)

Link to the assigned tutorial:
http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/

Deliverable:
  In your individual folder, list all of the unix commands that you learned, with a brief description of each.


### Assignment 2) Complete the Python tutorial on the Software Carpentry website:

If you are not yet familiar with the basics of Python, begin on the following website, and begin your
journey in the amazing, scary, and powerful world of python. This website allows you learn the basics
of python from a web-based version of python, so you can begin this even before you have python installed
on your computer. We prefer that you run the commands on your own computer but this is a very good way to
get started.

Deliverable:
   Save each of the plots that you create with the tutorial and save them in your google drive folder.
   
### Paper of the week: Assignment 3) Read this exoplanet review paper:

* Exoplanets Review by Lee (2018). (link in Google Drive)
* Read the paper, and save a list of questions you may have.
* Read the paper again a few days later, and revisit your list of questions
* Post at least one question on Piazza, and respond to at least one of your classmates' questions.



### Bonus Round ( Intended for everyone. see how far you can get)
Command line Ninjas begin their training with the most simple commands they use everyday and eventually obtain 
more and more skills. Follow the link below and see how far you get in the command-line-challenge. Be sure to
keep track of you progress so that you can report back.

### Optional Assignment) Complete the Data Carpentry workshop on Git and Version Control
In modern astronomy, we have learned from the computer science community that we should back up our code. OFTEN.
Git and the most commonly used web-based git repository github.com are used by thousands of collaborations to
store their code and collaborate in open source projects. Git can initially be overwhelming, but with practice
it will become one of your mostly commonly used tools in astronomy.

## Writing Prompt (5-7 mins):
* What are your goals for this course?
* What topics in astronomy interest you? e.g. astrobiology, exoplanets, dark energy, black holes, space launches, mars exploration, the rings of saturn, Earth-like planets, etc.
