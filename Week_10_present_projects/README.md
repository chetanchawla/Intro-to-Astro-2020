- Logistics
- Student project Updates


### Discussion of Research Topics
- Any questions about final projects so far?
- Each student will spend 5 minutes (no slides) describing their project to the class.
- Remember to post your research proposals on your website.



Teaching notes: We had each student produce one question on the paper, in the chat, in order to engage the students. Each student then read their question, and the mentors can answer accordingly. It's important to give constructive feedback to everyone who presents today. Also, encourage them to finish the project in this week, because beyond that it's very difficult to finish, as people move on into their regular semester work.
